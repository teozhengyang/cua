# Backend Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed
- ✅ `backend/app/services/computer_use_service.py` - No longer needed, executor handles this
- ✅ `backend/app/tools/` (entire directory) - Tools moved to executor service  
- ✅ `backend/app/api/routes/computer_use.py` - Computer use routes removed, use executor directly

## Files Modified

### `backend/app/services/actor_service.py`
- ✅ Replaced `ComputerUseService` with `ExecutorClient`
- ✅ Tool execution now happens via HTTP calls to executor
- ✅ Added health check and tool listing methods

### `backend/app/services/executor_client.py`
- ✅ Removed dependency on `app.tools.ToolResult`
- ✅ Created local `ToolResult` class for compatibility

### `backend/app/planner/anthropic_agent.py`
- ✅ Updated to use `tool_definitions` instead of `tools`
- ✅ Removed execution logic, kept only API definitions

### `backend/app/api/dependencies.py`
- ✅ Removed `get_executor_client()` dependency (not needed by routes anymore)
- ✅ Kept `get_actor_service()` for planner routes

### `backend/app/main.py`  
- ✅ Removed computer_use router
- ✅ Simplified to only include health and planner routes

## Files Added

### `backend/app/tool_definitions.py`
- ✅ Lightweight tool definitions for Claude API
- ✅ No execution logic, just schema definitions
- ✅ Used by AnthropicActor to provide tool schemas to Claude

## Benefits
- 🎯 **Cleaner separation**: Backend focuses on business logic, executor handles computer use
- 📦 **Smaller backend**: Removed ~300+ lines of tool-related code
- 🔧 **Simpler dependencies**: Backend only needs HTTP client, not computer use tools
- 🚀 **Better scalability**: Executor can be deployed/scaled independently
- 🐛 **Easier debugging**: Computer use issues isolated to executor service

## Architecture Flow
```
Frontend → Backend (ActorService) → ExecutorClient → HTTP → Executor → Tools
```

## Testing
- ✅ Backend starts successfully
- ✅ Integration test detects executor service status
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly
